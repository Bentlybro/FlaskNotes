# FlaskNotes
A lightweight note-taking application built with Flask, featuring a clean web interface for creating and managing notes. The application uses a RESTful API architecture and SQLite3 for persistent storage, allowing users to create, retrieve, and manage their notes efficiently.

Prompt: "Lets make a python flask api based note taking app, so a basic web ui and i should be able to enter text and save it as a note and its saved via the flask api, we should use sqlite3 for a basic database to store the notes too"

I tested to see if this works and i am supreised to say it does load the web page but it does not properly save the notes because the save functionality in the html/JavaScript was not fully added, but this is designed to be a base setup of a project which this is

Here is the code that needs to be finished then this would save the notes
```
  // Basic JavaScript functions for API interaction
  async function saveNote() {
      // Implementation for saving notes
  }
  
  async function loadNotes() {
      // Implementation for loading notes
  }
  
  async function deleteNote(noteId) {
      // Implementation for deleting notes
  }
```
